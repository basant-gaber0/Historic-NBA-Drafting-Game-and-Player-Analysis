# Historic-NBA-Drafting-Game-and-Player-Analysis
This project uses Jupyter Notebook as an interactive environment for data analysis and visualization of historic NBA data. It combines effective tools for data exploration, focusing on drafting trends, game statistics, and player performance. The first part of the project highlights the visualization tools used for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), enabling users to analyze numerical and categorical attributes to understand the data and the relationships between variables. The second part demonstrates insights gained from the analysis, such as drafting strategies, player development trends, and game performance metrics.



## Dataset 

The database that was used in this project to evaluate the usage of the notebook is [basketball.sqlite]([https://www.kaggle.com/rikdifos/nba-salary-and-statistics-201617](https://www.kaggle.com/code/agilesifaka/historic-nba-drafting-game-and-player-analysis/input?select=basketball.sqlite)) 

## Run locally

To clone the repo:

bash
  git clone https://github.com/basant-gaber0/Historic-NBA-Drafting-Game-and-Player-Analysis.git




## Exploratory data analysis

[Basant Gaber _ historic-nba-drafting-game-and-player-analysis_questions.ipynb]([https://github.com/DimitrisReppas/A-notebook-for-complete-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-SQL/blob/main/A_Notebook_for_complete_EDA.ipynb](https://github.com/basant-gaber0/Historic-NBA-Drafting-Game-and-Player-Analysis/blob/main/Basant%20Gaber%20_%20historic-nba-drafting-game-and-player-analysis_questions.ipynb)) is a Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the exploratory data analysis. In this notebook, one can find:

 - Connection to the database (SQLite)

 - Retrieval of primary information from the dataset

 - Draft analysis, including trends and success rates

 - Game analysis, exploring scoring trends, win/loss patterns, and team performance

 - Player performance analysis, focusing on career stats and longevity

 - Visualizations of relationships between key variables (e.g., draft position vs. player success)
